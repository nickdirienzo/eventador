Hey
everyone
,
Tomorrow
evening
,
before
the
ball
,
we
will
be
screening
The
Clay
Bird
which
is
a
foreign
film
from
Bangladesh
with
the
MSA
.
Afterwards
,
we
plan
to
have
a
discussion
with
Imam
Sohaib
about
the
film
and
some
of
its
themes
.
The
Clay
Bird
is
a
film
based
on
the
1971
War
in
Bangladesh
.
It
tells
the
story
of
a
boy
who
is
sent
to
study
at
a
madrassa
and
the
hardships
his
family
faces
.
It
shows
different
facets
of
faith
,
culture
,
and
society
in
the
backdrop
of
war
.
This
film
is
a
winter
of
various
awards
and
earned
a
nomination
as
Best
Foreign
Film
in
2002
.

No
,
it's
not
JUST
another
anime
screening
,
it's
Another
anime
screening
.
That
is
to
say
,
it's
an
anime
screening
of
Another
.
We're
watching
Another
at
the
anime
screening
tonight
.
THE
NAME
OF
THE
ANIME
IS
ANOTHER
.
For
those
of
you
who
have
never
heard
of
it
before
,
Another
is
a
delightful
school
life
romantic
comedy
with
a
focus
on
cooking
,
specifically
the
baking
and
consumption
of
pie
.
Did
I
say
delightful
?
I
meant
delicious
.
Unfortunately
,
due
to
budget
restraints
in
the
animation
department
,
during
the
creation
of
the
show
,
they
had
to
cut
out
almost
all
of
the
visible
pies
,
simply
because
their
budget
couldn't
support
the
level
of
flavor
that
the
pastries
represented
.
As
a
result
,
most
of
the
cooking
and
pie
-
related
segments
of
the
show
occur
off
-
screen
,
and
we're
left
to
extrapolate
how
delicious
the
pies
are
by
the
faces
of
the
characters
when
they're
on
-
screen
.
Apparently
they're
pretty
amazing
pies
,
because
the
red
,
juicy
filling
of
the
pies
,
which
I'm
assuming
are
cherry
flavored
,
is
ofter
splattered
all
over
the
characters
.
Sometimes
they've
eaten
so
much
pie
that
the
filling
starts
oozing
out
of
their
eyes
or
jumping
straight
from
inside
their
stomach
to
their
skin
,
and
that
blood
-
red
.
.
.
cherry
filling
.
.
.
just
splatters
all
over
the
place
.
You
know
how
sometimes
people
eat
something
and
say
,
I'm
in
heaven
!
because
it's
so
delicious
?
That
happens
to
some
of
the
characters
too
,
except
they
don't
have
time
to
say
the
line
before
they
actually
go
to
heaven
.
I
guess
what
I'm
trying
to
say
is
,
if
for
some
reason
you're
uncomfortable
with
gratuitous
amounts
of
sanguine
pie
-
filling
bursting
out
of
your
favorite
characters
,
then
you
probably
shouldn't
come
to
Another
@
Lewis LOCATION
120 LOCATION
@

,
because
you
probably
wouldn't
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
the
Pizza
we'll
be
eating
.
But
if
you
like
cooking
,
school
life
,
rom
-
com
,
or
'horror
,
'
which
this
series
is
technically
classified
as
for
some
reason
,
you
should
probably
come
see
why
pies
are
so
great
.
Wait
,
did
I
say
delicious
?
I
meant
disturbing
.

Hey
Forbes
!
The
first
Princeton
Perspective
Project
speaker
event
with
Rachel
Simmons
is
today
!
Rachel
received
the
Rhodes
Scholarship
and
then
dropped
out
of
the
program
to
create
her
own
path
towards
success
.
During
her
talk
,
she
will
open
up
about
some
of
her
struggles
and
setbacks
,
and
give
some
tips
on
how
we
can
deal
with
our
own
.
Rachel
has
appeared
on
Oprah
twice
,
was
the
host
of
a
PBS
Show
,
A
Girl's
Life
,
and
has
written
for
many
online
publications
.

After
her
talk
,
we'll
have
small
group
discussions
for
you
to
talk
with
other
Princetonians
about
-
How
the
culture
at
Princeton
tends
to
lead
us
to
only
take
one
path
toward
success
-
Why
we're
hesitant
to
take
big
risks
,
and
how
we
can
change
that
-
What
it
means
to
find
our
own
inner
voice
and
do
what
we
really
want
to
do
in
life
The
event
begins
